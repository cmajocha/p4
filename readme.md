## Description
PFL Fantasy Finders Keepers is an supplemental site for my fantasy football league known as the PFL. Our league is a keeper league with some complicated rules in place for keeping players on your roster from season to season. This site would help us keep track of who can be kept, how many years you can keep them, and and the current keepers are on your roster.  

## Demo
The demo video for my project can be found here: [Youtube - Courtney Majocha](http://laravel.com/docs).

## Details for the Teaching Team
My site has user authentication. I have created different experiences for logged in users vs. guests to the site. Logged in users will have the ability to view their roster, add players to their team, edit the players on their team, and delete the players from their team. They will also have the ability to look at players across everyone's roster to see who the potential keepers are throughout the league. This is important, because we allow trades in the league. It will be really helpful for league members to be able to look up players to see if they'd want to target them on the trade market.
